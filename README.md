# finance
A collection of Jupyter notebooks relating to Finance. Just mucking around and playing with code i've picked up from books, courses and the internet. Currently
the topics explored are Portfolio Analysis and Time Series.

The utilities script has a handful of functions I used within the jupyter notebooks to make them look less cluttered.
